## Setting up <em>dpd_cpp</em> on the HPC
<br>
**<em>dpd\_cpp</em>** has been compiled on the **HPC** in such a way that allows us to use it's executable programs from anywhere within the **HPC**. It does so by using what are known as runtime libraries, in the form of `.so` or shared object files. These libraries contain most of the actual code the programs use. And so, certain path variables in your `csh` environment need to be updated, so it can find the executables, and the `.so` files they require, whenever you run them.  
  
Instructions for updating your paths as well as compiling **<em>dpd\_cpp</em>** are given below. You can also find a brief description of **<em>dpd\_cpp</em>**'s current executable programs which build and process our triblock simulations.
