<p>My name is Hayden Fuss. I am senior at NC State University, double majoring in Materials Science and Engineering, and Computer Science. If you need to contact me, please email me at <a href="mailto:whfuss@ncsu.edu">whfuss@ncsu.edu</a>.</p>

<p>
For the past two years, I've worked as an undergraduate researcher in the Yingling Research Group, where I write post-processing software for Dissipative Particle Dynamics (DPD) simulations. I write the analysis software in C/C++, and use Python and Bash to submit jobs to NCSU's HPC and plot our results. 
</p>

<p>
This past summer, I worked on a team research project at Harvard University where we conducted a big data study of the Boston Marathon bombings using 311 (non-emergency) reports, 911 dispatches, and geocoded tweets from the Boston area. We used existing Python libraries and modules, such as matplotlib and scikit-learn, to plot our data over animated maps of Boston in order to track how information and sentiment spread throughout the region. 
</p>

<p>
Lastly, I have fun by trying to program video games. I played with programming games first in Java, and then using SDL in C/C++. Although, I am currently learning Unity and taking CSC 481 this semester.
</p>

<p>
As far as my strengths go, I am a quick learner, decent at math and physics, and very persistent.
